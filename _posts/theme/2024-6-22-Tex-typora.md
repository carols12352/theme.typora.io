# Tex Typora Theme
A Tex Typora theme based on [Keldos-Li / typora-latex-theme](https://github.com/Keldos-Li/typora-latex-theme/), still under the GPL3.0 license.

## Modification Notes

1. Changed link style to pure black without underline, more in line with LaTeX design.
2. Automatic footnotes: Added a counter for non-TOC links, all reference links will be automatically marked with footnotes and won't be affected by the TOC.
3. Modified H5 title style to ( ), the counter resets every time a new title is inserted.
4. Modified H6 title style to be centered, with a normal text size to simulate annotations under images.
5. Improved display of formulas and source code.
6. Added detailed comments to the source code to facilitate modification and adjustment by developers.
